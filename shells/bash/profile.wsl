## Fix missing umask value for WSL (see https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/795)
# You can change the default permissions for the files you create by setting the umask
# value in your .profile. The umask is the complement of the maximal permissions of a file.
# Common values include 022 (writable only by the owner, readable and executable by everyone),
# 077 (access only by the owner), and 002 (like 022, but also group-writable).
# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
umask 022

# Change /etc/wsl.conf as below to make chmod work, the above `umask 022` don't work on WSL2
